# Rails Training: Done Right

Hey, Seattle! You've been thinking about learning web development (good for you!). Maybe you even tried an online Rails tutorial (but where's the tutor?).

Wouldn't it be easier if you could:
— actually ask the questions that YOU want answered?
— see real-world examples from experienced developers?
— connect with other learners at your same level?

You'll be amazed at what you can build after taking this one-day crash course in starting Ruby on Rails development.
